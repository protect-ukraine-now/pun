Dear Ukraine Supporters, Ukraine's survival and victory depends on military aid from the US and the timely delivery of it.

With the new Administration in place, this is essential for all Ukraine Supporters to call the White House, their Senators and Representatives and voice their support for continuing the military aid to Ukraine. We must be clear that the only lasting peace possible with the Russian Federation is a Peace Through Strength. Â

# Urgent Call to Action: Stand with Ukraine!

The diplomatic failure at the White House during President Zelensky’s visit has set off a wave of unprecedented events and policy shifts. Now, more than ever, **Ukraine supporters must take action**. Across the country, people are rallying in the streets, demanding increased support for Ukraine.

We urge you to **submit the letter below the Congress**—remind our representatives that grassroots support for Ukraine remains strong among Americans. It is imperative that President Trump hears this message loud and clear: **The U.S. must stand against aggression and support Ukraine’s fight for freedom.**

Reaching out to **your Members of Congress is crucial**, especially if you live in a **Republican** district or state. Every voice matters, and your engagement can make a real difference.

This is an **all-hands-on-deck moment**. We cannot afford to be silent.

**Act now. Let your voice be heard. Submit the letter below** and take a stand for Ukraine today!

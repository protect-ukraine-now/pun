# Ukraine needs Your Support!

Three years ago, when Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the American people—like many others around the world—responded with overwhelming and unprecedented support. We all remember the powerful rallies held in major cities and small towns across the United States and Europe, the extensive media coverage, and the countless articles highlighting Ukraine's plight. Polls consistently showed that supporting Ukraine was a bipartisan issue, transcending political divides in America.

Now, with a new administration in the White House, it is crucial that the American public demonstrates the same unwavering support for Ukraine to President Trump as it did to President Biden.

To every supporter of Ukraine who feels tired, disappointed, or unsure, to those who may have lost faith or moved on, and to anyone doubting Ukraine's defenders’ ability to repel the aggressor—here’s what you need to know:

**This is it folks!**  
The war is nearing its end, but how it ends is up to us. The outcome hinges on your voice and your actions.

This is your opportunity to send a clear message to President Trump: the only path to lasting peace with Russia is through **Peace Through Strength.** We must increase military aid to Ukraine now.

Your support matters more than ever. Let your voice be heard—act today.

# Urgent Call to Action: Stand with Ukraine!

The Pentagon has quietly frozen shipments of Patriot interceptors, 155 mm shells, and other life-saving munitions, even as Russia unleashes its heaviest missile and drone strikes of the entire war. If this pause sticks, innocent Ukrainians will die, and America’s credibility will crater.

**Congress alone has the power to influence the White House and DoD to reverse this decision.** Lawmakers act only when they feel pressure from us. Use the letter below to contact your Representative and both Senators. It takes five minutes. That five-minute investment could help save lives, stop Putin’s aggression cold, and strengthen U.S. security without sending a single American soldier to the front.

Share this link with friends, family, veterans’ groups, and civic networks. Every inbox on Capitol Hill should hear the same unmistakable message: **“No delays. No excuses. Arm Ukraine now.”**

**Act now. Let your voice be heard. Submit the letter below** and take a stand for Ukraine today!

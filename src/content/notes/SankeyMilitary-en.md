- **Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA)**: This is the fastest way to deliver military aid. The President can authorize transfers of existing US defense equipment directly from US stockpiles. It's ideal for immediate needs but limited by existing stock availability

- **Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI)**: This program allows the US government to purchase new equipment directly from defense contractors.  Unlike PDA, USAI provides more flexibility to acquire the latest equipment Ukraine needs, but it takes longer to procure and deliver

- **Foreign Military Financing (FMF)**:  This program offers grants or loans to eligible countries, including Ukraine, to purchase US defense articles and services.  Ukraine uses FMF funds to buy specific equipment and training through government-to-government agreements.  While offering flexibility in purchases, FMF requires negotiation and approval processes, leading to longer timelines compared to PDA

- According to our estimates, Ukraine has received approximately $4.2 billion worth of equipment procured through the USAI program

- Adjusted for accounting errors for $8.2B
